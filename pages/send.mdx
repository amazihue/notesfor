- **Guidelines**
  1. Be kind – you’re trying to encourage them!
  2. Share something general, such as "a third grader from Kansas."
  3. Address it to one person ("you"), not "you guys."

**Example**
Hi friend, 
I bet you're feeling scared and tired. I bet you're feeling alone. But I want you to know that you're brave. 
You are able. You are strong. You are not alone even if it feels that way. Love, a student from Colorado
